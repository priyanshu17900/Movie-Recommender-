# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Python)

A content-based movie recommendation system built using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**, with a **Python-only Streamlit frontend**.

The project workflow is:
- **Google Colab notebook** for data processing and vector generation
- **Streamlit app** for interactive movie recommendations

---

## 🚀 Features

- Content-based movie recommendations
- TF-IDF vectorization on movie descriptions
- Cosine similarity for finding similar movies
- Python-only frontend using Streamlit
- Performance optimizations using caching and fast lookup

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Movie data is loaded and processed in a **Google Colab notebook**
2. Text features are converted into TF-IDF vectors
3. Processed artifacts are saved using pickle
4. Streamlit loads the saved artifacts
5. Users select a movie and receive similar recommendations

This is a **content-based recommender system**.
